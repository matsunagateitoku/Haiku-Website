**Natsume Sōseki** (1867–1916) was one of Japan's most renowned authors, known for his profound influence on modern Japanese literature. Initially trained as a scholar of English literature, he became a writer and poet whose works often explored themes of identity, self-awareness, and the complexities of the human experience. Sōseki's haiku and other poetry reflect his deep introspection and connection to nature, blending Western literary sensibilities with traditional Japanese forms. His famous novel *I Am a Cat* and his poetry remain widely celebrated for their wit, insight, and emotional depth.
