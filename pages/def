A **haiku** is a traditional form of Japanese poetry characterized by its concise structure and focus on nature, seasons, and moments of observation or insight. It consists of **three lines** with a syllabic pattern of **5-7-5**:

1. The first line has 5 syllables.
2. The second line has 7 syllables.
3. The third line has 5 syllables.

Haikus often evoke a sense of simplicity, capturing a fleeting moment or a profound image, usually related to nature. They may also include a **kigo** (seasonal word) that indicates the time of year, and sometimes a **kireji** (cutting word) that creates a pause or contrast, adding depth or reflection to the poem.

While the classic form originates from Japan, haikus have been adapted in many languages, and contemporary haikus may vary in structure while retaining the spirit of brevity and observation.
